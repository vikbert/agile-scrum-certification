# 2. Scrum Practices (45%)
## Scrum roles
The Scrum team consists of a product owner, the development team, and a scrum master. Scrum teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. 

### Explain the Product Owner role
- The Role "Product Owner" belongs to one person, who is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of development team. 

- The PO is one person from the performing organization, who may represent the desire of a committee. 

- The PO is responsible for managing the product backlog: changing the product backlog and the item's priority. Product Owners should communicate effectively with the customers and use the information to keep the Product Backlog updated with all the changes.

- Product Owners measure the performance of the project, forecast the completion date, and make this information transparent to all stakeholders.

- The entire organization must respect the PO's decisions for the project to be successful.


### Explain the Scrum Master role
- Scrum Masters are those who fully understand Scrum, and help the Scrum Team by coaching them, and ensuring that all scrum processes are implemented correctly. 
- Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum team, who removes impediments to the Development Team and helps both Development team and product owner.
- Scrum Master should also help those outside the scrum team understand the appropriate interactions with Scrum Team in order to maximize the business value.
- Most of internal and external communications about the Scrum process are done by Scrum Master.

### Explain the Development Team role
Members of the Development team are application area experts who are responsible for delivering backlog items, and managing their own efforts. They should be cross-funktional and self-organized. They should be aligned with the goal of the project and deliver the final product of the project in step by step Increments. Scrum is mostly effective when there are 3 to 9 Development Team members.


### Recognize the role of a traditional Project Manager
There is no such role "Project Manager" in Scrum and none of the three roles of Scrum act as a traditional Project Manager. In fact, the project management responsibilities are distributed among the three roles of Scrum and there is no centralized project management in Scrum.

## Scrum events
There are five events in a Scrum Project: Sprint, Spring planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.

### Explain the characteristics of time-boxed events
Exvents with a predefined maxium duration of time are time-boxed events. All Events in Scrum must be timeboxed. The duration of a timebox should be agreed upon and fixed. The duration of a timebox should be agreed upon and fixed. We are free to change the duration, but not frequently, and never based on single occasions.

### Explain the characteristics of Sprints

Each scrum project delivers the product in a number of iterations, which are called `Sprints`. Sprint has the following characteristics:

- An Increment is developed in each sprint and this increment keeps getting bigger after each Sprint and is potentially releasable part of the final project.
- Sprint is a timeboxed event and is always fixed at one month or less.
- The items of the `sprint backlog` should not be changed, after the sprint is started
- Each items in the `Product Backlog` shoulod normally be developed in a single sprint.
- A 99% completed item is not considered as `Done` in a sprint and would not be part of the increment delivered by the current sprint and would not be demonstrated to the customer at the Sprint review.
- A sprint is cancelable by Product Owner, when the sprint goal becomes obsolete.
- There is no such things as `Sprint 0`, and there is no difference between the first sprint and the rest of sprints.


### Explain the characteristics of the Daily Scrum

- Daily Scrum is normally a 15-minute meeting for the Development Team
- It must be held on a daily basis, and at the same time and same place throughout the current Sprint
- Each member of the Develop Team should answer the three questions in Daily Scrum: (1) what has been done since the last meeting (2) What will be done before the next meeting (3) what obstacles are in the way
- Daily Scrum is just a Meeting for Development Team
- Development Team should monitor Sprint progress each day.


### Explain the characteristics of the Sprint Review 
At the end of the sprint, the Scrum team and the other stakeholders gather and hold a meeting to present and insepect the `Done` items from the current sprint. Such meeting is called `Sprint Review`.
Sprint review has the following characteristics:

- Sprint Review must be timeboxed, normally 4 hours for a one-month sprint, i.e. 2 hours for a two-week sprint
- The presentation of the Increment in this meeting is intended to collect feedback and raise the change requests as soon as possible.
- Ohly the items which are 100% completed should be presented and explained in sprint review. Any item that is not `Done`, will go back to the product backlog and the Product Owner will order it again.
- the Product Owner should discuss the status of the Product Backlog and the likely completion dates based on the progress, if possible.
- the whole scrum team collaborates on revising the product backlog based on the output of the sprint, and the feedback received from the customer.

### Explain the characteristics of the Sprint Retrospective
After the spring review and just before the end of the sprint, another meeting will be held, aimed at process improvement, which is called `Sprint Retrospective`.

- It is normally three hours for one-month sprint, i.e. 1.5 hour for two-weeks sprint.
- The Scrum Team should always look for the ways to improve, with regard to people, relationships, processes, and tools, and identify ways of improving them in the next Sprint.
