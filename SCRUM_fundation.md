# 2. Scrum Practices (45%)
## Scrum roles
The Scrum team consists of a product owner, the development team, and a scrum master. Scrum teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. 

### Explain the Product Owner role
- The Role "Product Owner" belongs to one person, who is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of development team. 

- The PO is one person from the performing organization, who may represent the desire of a committee. 

- The PO is responsible for managing the product backlog: changing the product backlog and the item's priority. Product Owners should communicate effectively with the customers and use the information to keep the Product Backlog updated with all the changes.

- Product Owners measure the performance of the project, forecast the completion date, and make this information transparent to all stakeholders.

- The entire organization must respect the PO's decisions for the project to be successful.


### Explain the Scrum Master role
- Scrum Masters are those who fully understand Scrum, and help the Scrum Team by coaching them, and ensuring that all scrum processes are implemented correctly. 
- Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum team, who removes impediments to the Development Team and helps both Development team and product owner.
- Scrum Master should also help those outside the scrum team understand the appropriate interactions with Scrum Team in order to maximize the business value.
- Most of internal and external communications about the Scrum process are done by Scrum Master.

### Explain the Development Team role
Members of the Development team are application area experts who are responsible for delivering backlog items, and managing their own efforts. They should be cross-funktional and self-organized. They should be aligned with the goal of the project and deliver the final product of the project in step by step Increments. Scrum is mostly effective when there are 3 to 9 Development Team members.


### Recognize the role of a traditional Project Manager
There is no such role "Project Manager" in Scrum and none of the three roles of Scrum act as a traditional Project Manager. In fact, the project management responsibilities are distributed among the three roles of Scrum and there is no centralized project management in Scrum.

## Scrum events
There are five events in a Scrum Project: Sprint, Spring planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.

### Explain the characteristics of time-boxed events
Exvents with a predefined maxium duration of time are time-boxed events. All Events in Scrum must be timeboxed. The duration of a timebox should be agreed upon and fixed. The duration of a timebox should be agreed upon and fixed. We are free to change the duration, but not frequently, and never based on single occasions.

### Explain the characteristics of Sprints

Each scrum project delivers the product in a number of iterations, which are called `Sprints`. Sprint has the following characteristics:

- An Increment is developed in each sprint and this increment keeps getting bigger after each Sprint and is potentially releasable part of the final project.
- Sprint is a timeboxed event and is always fixed at one month or less.
- The items of the `Sprint Backlog` should not be changed, after the sprint is started
- Each item in the `Product Backlog` shoulod normally be developed in a single sprint.
- A 99% completed item is not considered as `Done` in a sprint and would not be part of the increment delivered by the current sprint and would not be demonstrated to the customers at the `Sprint Review`.
- A sprint is cancelable by Product Owner, when the sprint goal becomes obsolete.
- There is no such things as `Sprint 0`, and there is no difference between the first sprint and the rest of sprints.


### Explain the characteristics of the Daily Scrum

- `Daily Scrum` is normally a `15-minute` meeting for the Development Team
- It must be held on a daily basis, and at the same time and same place throughout the current Sprint
- Each member of the Develop Team should answer the `three` questions in Daily Scrum: 
**(1)** what has been done since the last meeting **(2)** What will be done before the next meeting **(3)** what obstacles are in the way
- Daily Scrum is just a Meeting for Development Team
- The Development Team should monitor Sprint progress each day.


### Explain the characteristics of the Sprint Review 
At the end of the sprint, the Scrum Team and the other stakeholders gather and hold a meeting to present and insepect the `Done` items from the current sprint. Such meeting is called `Sprint Review`.
Sprint review has the following characteristics:

- The Sprint Review must be timeboxed, normally `4 hours for a one-month sprint`, i.e. 2 hours for a two-week sprint
- The presentation of the Increment in this meeting is intended to collect feedback and raise the change requests as soon as possible.
- Ohly the items which are 100% completed should be presented and explained in sprint review. Any item that is not `Done`, will go back to the Product Backlog and the Product Owner will order it again.
- the Product Owner should discuss the status of the Product Backlog and the likely completion dates based on the progress, if possible.
- the whole Scrum Team collaborates on revising the Product Backlog based on the output of the sprint, and the feedback received from the customers.

### Explain the characteristics of the Sprint Retrospective
After the spring review and just before the end of the sprint, another meeting will be held, aimed at process improvement, which is called `Sprint Retrospective`.

- It is normally `three hours for one-month sprint`, i.e. 1.5 hour for two-weeks sprint.
- The Scrum Team should always look for the ways to improve, with regard to people, relationships, processes, and tools, and identify ways of improving them in the next Sprint.

## The importance of the Backlog
### Explain the characteristics of a good Product and Sprint Backlog

`Product Backlog` is an ordered list of everything(usually user stories) that might be needed in the final product. A good Product Backlog has the following characteristics:

- `easy understandable`: The items of the Product Backlog are described in simple, non-technical, business language, and are easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders.
- `presentable`: they are presentable to very stakeholder
- `dynamical`: The Product Backlog is dynnamically changing and improving and it is never complete.
- `ordered by business value`: The Product Backlog items will be ordered based on their `business value`. The items located at the top of the Product Backlog that have higher business value, will be delivered earlier.
- `estimated`: Each Product Backlog item has a work estimate, which is done by the Development Team.
- `refined by Scrum Team` The Scrum Team should add details, estimates, and order to the Product Backlog items all the way through the project, which is called `Product Backlog Grooming`. It should not consume more than 10% of the time of the Development Team.
- `based on dicussion`: The Product Backlog is created based on discussion rather than documentation.
- `single Product Backlog only`: There should be only one Product Backlog, no matter how many Scrum Teams are working on the project.


`Sprint Backlog` is an ordered list of selected items from the Product Backlog to be delievered through a Sprint, along with the Sprint Goal and plans for delivering the items and realizing the Spring Goal.

### Recognize good User Stories and Backlog Items
The most common type of Backlog items is user stories, which must be non-technical, and independent.
They should have such format: as a [role], I want to do [something], in order to [purpose].

A good user story should be able to follow the guidline named `INVEST`:
- Independent: if the items are not independent, you are not able to order them based on their business values.
- Negotiable: The user stories are also communication tools
- Valuable: this value is the basis for ordering the items in Backlog
- estimate-able: We only have to have reliable estimates for the items at the top of the Product Backlog.
- Small: Only the items at the top of the Product Backlog have to be small; it is OK for the rest of them to be big or even unclear.
- Testable: testing is always a part of the Defintion of Done.
